<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal:</h3>

<p>Design implementation complete (Looks right, UX interactions done), with stubbed backend calls</p>

<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deliverable:</h3>

<p>A link to your repositories with .readme file of install + run instructions so we can test your solution ourselves.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements:</h3>

<p>This should be built with a modern MVVM/MVP/MVC js architecture (Angular), 
as well as a well supported CSS framework (Example: Compass). This solution should have backwards compatibility backwards compatibility with browsers (IE8+ is sufficient), and cross browser support is expected. Final solution should feel polished , and have a good attention to detail on visuals / animations / etc.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design:</h3>

<p>On the following 3 pages you'll find the design for this project. The design is for a single list with elements that can expand and contract, with only one element open at a time. You can see that there are 2 types of items in the list, Firewall and
Build . Firewall items can be accepted (page 1), or rejected (page 2). Builds can succeed (page 3), or fail (not shown). Note that the mock-ups are all from the exact moment in time, with each page showing a different element expanded.
Grey boxes (while not shown in the expanded state), represent either an item that will not run (as the entry has already failed like item 432460), or an item that has yet to run (as the item is currently working like item 432462)
Lastly, when an element is in the expanded state, each of the 4 content boxes should act as a button, allowing the user to get more information about that item. These details will be shown in a pop-over content view on the page. This detail view is not a requirement of the assignment.

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>To mock your back-end, use the <a href="https://www.mockable.io/">mockable</a> service;</li>
    <li>All data (etc. json) should be saved within <a href="https://www.mockable.io/">mockable</a> service that needed to the design implementation and taken by your requests</li>
  </ul
</p>

<p>
  We realize that the above is not a complete specification, and the expectation is for you to implement a solution based on the information you have. When unsure how to proceed make a decision based on your instincts on what should be done based on your experience.
